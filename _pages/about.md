Welcome to Sihao Xiao's Homepage.

I'm currently a graduate student in Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITP-CAS).

My research interests are particle cosmology and early universe, including beyond standard model, first order cosmic phase transition, primordial black holes and gravitational waves.
